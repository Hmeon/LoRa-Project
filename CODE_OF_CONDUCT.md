# Code of Conduct

This project follows the **Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1)**.
We expect all participants to help keep this community welcoming, inclusive, and professional.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is
officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Open a GitHub issue titled **`[CoC] ...`** and mention **@Hmeon** (the maintainer will follow up).
- If you want a private channel, post **minimal details** and request a private follow-up method.

Security vulnerabilities are handled separately: see `SECURITY.md`.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will follow these community impact guidelines:

1) **Correction**
   - Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.
   - Consequence: A private or public warning and clarification.

2) **Warning**
   - Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
   - Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior.

3) **Temporary Ban**
   - Community Impact: Serious or sustained violations.
   - Consequence: A temporary ban from interaction.

4) **Permanent Ban**
   - Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation or harassment.
   - Consequence: Permanent removal from the community.
